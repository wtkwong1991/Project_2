Oil & Gas Wells data analysis in 
Loving county (Midland Basin)

Team: Tommy, Saurav, Hocine, Wilton and Karista 

Proposal:

The purpose of the project is to provide E&P and service companies a data Analytics tool that help to compare actual and historical oil and gas wells data in Loving county- Midland basin 
1. Evaluate the possibility of drilling success (drilling new wells)
2. Increase the productivity by improving the performance of active producing wells

The project is going to be in a form of a dashboard that contain three part:
First: geo map of all producing wells in Loving County-Texas 
Second: analysis- pie charts, bar charts, bubble chart, to show the existing correlation between the oil and gas production amount and different variables such as type of well, formation, drilling depth (TVD), perforated length, lateral length, the quantity of injected fluid, etc. 
•	Production VS (depth (TVD), perforated length, lateral length, frac size) 
•	Top producing operators in the loving county 
•	Top producing wells in the Loving county 
Third: a table that contain all Loving County wells data (a form? Or a table with a filter option)
	 


Data Source:
Oil and Gas data queries: Texas Railroad Commission of Texas 
•	Wellbore query: 
-	complete list of wells in the field by operator 
•	Completion query:
-	MD & TVD depths 
-	Spud date & days to drill 
-	Lateral length 
-	Frac size 
•	Public GIS Viewer:
-	Latitude / longitude 
•	 Production data query: 
-	Daily and monthly hydrocarbon volumes (oil & gas)
